### CPSC 120
* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 2 was the lab that confused me the most. I spent a lot of time trying to debug why there were two outputs to the code. The code was supposed to calculate the number of days between a start and end date but it outputed the number of days twice. All I had to do was change the return value to one of the functions. I learned to always check the return value on functions.

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2 was a favorite because it was the first time I used a pseudo random number generator. The code was a game where a secret random number would be generated between 1 and 10. Then, the player would guess a number between 1 and 10. After 5 guesses without entering the correct number, the player would lose. 

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 1 was one of my favorite labs because it was quick and simple. Although the code itself was fairly simple, the output of the code was fun. It was also the first time I used a counter controlled for-loop.
